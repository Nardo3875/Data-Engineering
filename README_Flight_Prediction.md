# Flight Price Prediction 
*By Leonard Newbill*

# Project Outline:

### Project Setup:
        Install Django and create a new project.
        Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Database Models:
        Define models for Airlines, Airports, Flights, and other relevant entities.
        Consider relationships between models (e.g., an airline has multiple flights).

### Integration with US Airlines API:
        Research and choose a suitable US airlines API.
        Integrate the API into your Django project.
        Create functions or classes to fetch flight data based on user queries (location, time, etc.).

### Flight Price Prediction:
        Gather historical flight data (you may need to manually collect or find a suitable dataset).
        Train a machine learning model for flight price prediction.
        Consider using libraries like scikit-learn for regression tasks.

### User Interface:
        Design and implement a user interface using Django templates and forms.
        Create views to handle user input and display flight predictions.

### User Authentication and Authorization:
        Implement user authentication to allow users to log in.
        Add authorization to restrict certain features to authenticated users only.

### User Input Handling:
        Allow users to input their travel details (departure location, destination, date, etc.).
        Validate user input on the server side.

### Display Predictions:
        Display predicted flight prices based on user input.
        Provide additional information such as airline details, departure times, etc.

### Testing:
        Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of different components.
        Perform integration testing to check the interaction between components.

### Deployment:
        Deploy your Django application on a hosting platform of your choice.
        Configure any necessary settings for deployment.

### Future Enhancements:
        Consider additional features such as notifications, user preferences, etc.
        Explore improving the prediction model over time.

### Technologies and Libraries:
```bash
      pip install Python
      pip install Django
      Django REST Framework (for API integration)
      Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the frontend)
      Database (SQLite or other, depending on your needs)
      Hosting platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
```
### Steps to Start:
    Set up your Django project.
    Create the necessary models.
    Integrate a sample API for testing.
    Develop the machine learning model for flight price prediction.
    Design the basic user interface.
